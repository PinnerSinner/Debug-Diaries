## What you learned
In building this game, you practiced using arrays to hold decks and hands, objects to store state, and booleans to track the gameâ€™s progress. You wrote conditional logic using if/else and operators to compare sums, loops to shuffle and render cards, and used the Math object for randomness. You also built functions that return values for scores, and manipulated the DOM. This hands-on project strengthens your understanding of these core JavaScript concepts.
