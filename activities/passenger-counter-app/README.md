# Passenger Counter App

This mini project is a simple web app built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It shows a real-time count of passengers and lets you increment, save, reset and clear your history. I built it to practise manipulating the DOM, handling click events and saving state to the page.

The interface uses a single card over a photograph of Pinner station in the UK. The count is displayed in big numbers and the buttons update the count on click. Styles are written in a separate CSS file; I tweaked them to use a blur filter on the card so the content stands out on the background.

## What I learned

- Declaring and updating variables in JavaScript (for example `count`).
- Manipulating the DOM with `getElementById` and changing `innerText`.
- Responding to user actions with `onclick` event listeners.
- Saving and resetting values as you click the buttons.
- Structuring a simple project with separate HTML, CSS and JS files.
- Using CSS gradients, background images and the `backdrop-filter` property to improve readability.
