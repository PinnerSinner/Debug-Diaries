# Debug Diaries

This repo is my public log of coding activities and experiments. Each activity lives in its own folder and is automatically published to GitHub Pages so you can run it in your browser. As I work through lessons and build small projects, I commit them here as-is.

Have a look inside the `activities/` folder to see what I'm learning next.
